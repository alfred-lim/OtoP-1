# Document Use of Subset_CocaMoby.py for Derivation of OtoP Dictionary

This file documents use of Subset_CocaMoby.py for the purpose of
building a training dictionary for use in an OtoP learning simulation
built in MikeNet. Dictionary entries, ortho/phono pairs together with
frequency weights, are derived from the CoCa and Moby
databases. Frequency information comes from CoCa
<http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/>, and O-to-P mappings from the Moby
Pronunciator <http://icon.shef.ac.uk/Moby/>.

Words selected for inclusion in the training dictionary are
monosyllabic and (mostly) mono-morphemic.

We incorporate some simple transformations to the Moby pronunciations
in order to facilitate use in a Mikenet framework.
